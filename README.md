## 💡 Inspiration & Methodology

### Inspiration

- **Multisensory Brands:** (Aesop, Lush, Le Labo) — sensory-rich, narrative-driven digital experiences.
- **Nature & Minimalism:**  
  Soft overlays, earth-inspired palettes, subtle animation, and tactile layering.
- **User-Centered Wellness:**  
  Every design decision supports calm, clarity, and trust.

### Design Thought Process

1. **Empathy First**  
   Designed for users seeking a moment of calm and delight in a busy world.
2. **Immersion**  
   Hero, ambient audio, and animated mist create a multi-sensory welcome.
3. **Narrative Flow**  
   Ingredient origins and testimonials build authenticity and human connection.
4. **Personalization Loop**  
   Interactive scent quiz and sticky CTAs keep users engaged and rewarded.
5. **Modern Accessibility**  
   Semantic HTML, focus states, ARIA labels, and color contrast for every user.
6. **Performance & Responsiveness**  
   All animations are CSS-based and respect user’s motion preferences. Layout is fluid from mobile to widescreen.
