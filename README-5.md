## ‚ú® Project Vision & Philosophy

### Core Goals

"The Scent" aims to be more than just another e-commerce site. It's envisioned as a digital sanctuary where users can mindfully explore and purchase high-quality aromatherapy products. The primary goals for v1.0 are:

1.  **Flawless User Experience:** A beautiful, intuitive, responsive, and accessible interface that guides users effortlessly from discovery to checkout. Mobile-first design is paramount.
2.  **Robust & Reliable Backend:** A stable, secure, and well-tested platform capable of handling typical e-commerce workloads, built on proven technologies.
3.  **Developer Ergonomics:** A clean, maintainable, and well-documented codebase that is easy for developers to understand, extend, and contribute to. Leverage the power and elegance of the Laravel ecosystem.
4.  **Future-Proof Architecture:** A modular design that facilitates future expansion, such as integrating new features (subscriptions, gift cards), scaling components independently, or potentially adopting a headless architecture.

### Guiding Principles

* **Simplicity & Elegance:** Strive for clarity in code and design. Leverage framework conventions but don't be afraid to deviate where it makes sense.
* **Security by Default:** Integrate security considerations from the outset, not as an afterthought. Follow best practices for web application security.
* **Test-Driven Development (TDD) Mindset:** Write tests alongside or before application code to ensure correctness and prevent regressions. Aim for high, meaningful test coverage.
* **Modularity & Decoupling:** Design components with clear responsibilities and minimal dependencies on each other, often facilitated by Domain-Driven Design concepts and Laravel's service container/event system.
* **Performance Awareness:** Build with performance in mind, utilizing caching, optimized queries, efficient background processing, and modern frontend techniques.
* **Accessibility First:** Ensure the application is usable by everyone, regardless of ability, by adhering to WCAG standards.

## üöÄ Key Features Deep Dive

This section elaborates on the highlights mentioned earlier.

### UI/UX Highlights

* **Responsive Design:** Fully adaptive layout for optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and smartphones using Tailwind CSS's responsive utilities.
* **Light/Dark Mode:** User-selectable themes stored in local storage and applied via CSS variables and Tailwind's `dark:` variant.
* **Interactive Elements:** Subtle animations, smooth transitions (potentially using SPA-like techniques with Turbo/Hotwire or Inertia.js if integrated later), and engaging micro-interactions powered by Alpine.js.
* **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA):** Semantic HTML structure, ARIA attributes where necessary, sufficient color contrast (defined in Tailwind config), keyboard navigability, focus indicators.
* **Parallax Scrolling:** Used judiciously on the landing page hero section for visual depth.
* **Ambient Sound Toggle:** An optional feature to enhance the calming atmosphere (implementation details TBD, likely simple HTML5 audio toggle).

### E-commerce Engine

* **Product Catalog:** Supports products with multiple categories, descriptive tags, variants (e.g., size, scent), rich descriptions, and high-quality images. Includes distinction between physical and digital goods.
* **Inventory Management:** Tracks stock levels per product/variant, prevents overselling. Potential for multi-warehouse support later.
* **Shopping Cart:** Persistent cart for logged-in users (database-backed), session-based cart for guests. Real-time updates via Alpine.js or potentially Livewire/Vue/React if added.
* **Flexible Checkout:** Supports guest checkout and registered user flows. Address management for logged-in users.
* **Discount Engine:** Applies coupon codes based on defined rules (percentage, fixed amount, usage limits, date ranges).
* **Tax Calculation:** Configurable tax rules based on shipping zones/product types.
* **Shipping Zones & Rates:** Define shipping methods and costs based on geographical regions.
* **Payment Integration:** Secure payment processing via adapters for Stripe (Cards, SEPA, etc.) and PayPal, utilizing their respective SDKs and handling webhooks for payment confirmation.

### Authentication & Authorization

* **Standard Authentication:** Secure email/password login with password hashing (bcrypt). Includes password reset functionality via email tokens.
* **Social Login:** Integration with popular providers (e.g., Google, Facebook) using Laravel Socialite.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Optional enhanced security via Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) or potentially WebAuthn (Passkeys) using relevant Laravel packages (e.g., `laravel/fortify` features or dedicated packages).
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Simple role system (e.g., `admin`, `staff`, `customer`) implemented using Laravel Gates & Policies to control access to specific actions or resources (like the admin dashboard).

### Admin Dashboard

* **Overview KPIs:** Real-time or near-real-time display of key metrics like total orders, revenue, new customers (implementation might use scheduled commands or event listeners to update cached stats).
* **Order Management:** View, search, filter orders. Update order status (pending, processing, shipped, completed, cancelled). Trigger fulfillment actions.
* **Product Management:** CRUD interface for products, categories, tags, variants, and inventory.
* **User Management:** View customer list, potentially manage roles (with caution).
* **Data Export:** Functionality to export orders or customer data to CSV format using packages like `maatwebsite/excel` or custom streaming responses.

### API Capabilities

* **RESTful API:** Versioned (`/api/v1/`) endpoints for core resources (products, cart, auth, orders). Follows standard HTTP verbs and status codes. See [API & Service Contracts](#-api--service-contracts-usage-guide) for details.
* **GraphQL API:** Optional secondary endpoint (`/graphql`) providing a flexible query language for clients, potentially powered by libraries like Lighthouse PHP.
* **Authentication:** Supports API token authentication (Laravel Sanctum) for SPAs or external clients, and secure signature verification for webhooks.
* **Rate Limiting:** Protects the API from abuse using Laravel's built-in rate limiting middleware.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack Rationale

The choice of technologies is crucial for building a modern, maintainable, and performant web application.

### Why Laravel 12?

* **Developer Productivity:** Laravel's elegant syntax, extensive features (routing, ORM, templating, queues, caching, testing utilities), and convention-over-configuration approach significantly speed up development.
* **Rich Ecosystem:** Access to a vast collection of official and community packages (Sail, Sanctum, Socialite, Telescope, Cashier, etc.) that solve common problems effectively.
* **Strong Community & Documentation:** Excellent official documentation and a large, active community provide ample support and resources.
* **Scalability Features:** Built-in support for queues, caching, task scheduling, and features like Octane make scaling applications easier.
* **Security Focus:** Laravel includes built-in protection against common web vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection, along with a clear security release process.

### Why Tailwind CSS 3?

* **Utility-First Efficiency:** Rapidly build custom designs without writing extensive custom CSS. Encourages consistency and maintainability.
* **Highly Configurable:** Easily customize the design system (colors, spacing, fonts) via the `tailwind.config.js` file.
* **Performance:** Just-in-Time (JIT) engine generates only the necessary CSS based on template usage, resulting in small production builds.
* **Responsive Design Focus:** Mobile-first responsive utilities are intuitive and powerful.
* **Dark Mode Support:** Built-in `dark:` variant simplifies implementing dark themes.

### Why Alpine.js?

* **Minimal & Lightweight:** Provides reactive and declarative JavaScript behavior directly within HTML templates without the overhead of larger frameworks like Vue or React, perfect for adding interactivity to server-rendered Blade views.
* **Laravel Synergy:** Works seamlessly with Blade components and complements Tailwind CSS well. Often sufficient for UI interactions in traditional full-stack applications.
* **Gentle Learning Curve:** Familiar syntax for developers experienced with Vue.js or basic JavaScript DOM manipulation.

### Why PHP 8.3?

* **Performance Improvements:** Each new PHP version brings performance gains. PHP 8.x introduced significant improvements, including the JIT compiler.
* **Modern Language Features:** Leverage features like readonly properties, enums, constructor property promotion, attributes, union/intersection types, fibers (for Octane), and more for cleaner, more expressive, and type-safe code.
* **Active Support & Security:** Using a recent, actively supported version ensures access to bug fixes and security updates.

### Why MariaDB 11.7?

* **Performance & Features:** A high-performance, open-source relational database, often considered a drop-in replacement for MySQL with potential performance advantages and additional features (e.g., advanced clustering, storage engines).
* **Compatibility:** Fully compatible with Laravel's Eloquent ORM and MySQL drivers.
* **Open Source:** Avoids vendor lock-in associated with some proprietary database systems.
* **Mature & Reliable:** Widely used and well-tested in production environments.

### Why Docker & Laravel Sail?

* **Consistent Development Environment:** Docker containers ensure that all developers (and CI/CD pipelines) run the application with the exact same dependencies and configurations, eliminating "it works on my machine" problems.
* **Simplified Setup:** Laravel Sail provides a simple command-line interface (`sail`) to manage the Docker environment (PHP, database, Redis, etc.), abstracting away complex Docker commands.
* **Isolation:** Prevents conflicts between different project dependencies installed directly on the host machine.
* **Production Parity (Closer):** While not identical, using Docker locally makes it easier to containerize the application for production deployment (e.g., on Fly.io or Kubernetes).
