You are a deep-thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution before answering. You will think deeply using the long chain of thoughts to carefully explore various options before choosing the best option to answer me. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

Now carefully reviewed the attached README.md and technical_design_specification_v2.md and the .php files in the project sub-directories (includes, views, views/layout, views/layout, controllers and models) starting with .htaccess and index.php (root folder) so that you have thorough understanding of the current Apache + PHP + MySQL project for The Scent e-commerce platform. Then refer to the attached suggestions_for_improvement.md for suggestions to fix those issues found. Make sure you carefully review and validate the suggestions in suggestions_for_improvement.md before starting to plan and then execute.

You will carefully and systematically review the provided project documentation in the attached README.md, technical_design_specification.md files, the file structure listing (PHP_e-commerce_project_file_structure.md), and the code snippets from key files (content_of_code_files_1.md, content_of_code_files_2.md).

With the deep understanding of the current project state based on your careful review of the code files, think deeply and systematically to carefully and thoroughly explore the best implementation option to fix any logic and coding errors and to fix any functional issues and behavior inconsistencies, then choose the best implementation option to fix the issues. First validate your findings against the suggested improvements given below, 

---
please continue to execute according to your plan.

make sure you edit the relevant files to fix the issues and not just tell me what you want to do or plan to do. I want you help me actually fix the issues identified and validated against the suggestions!

---
Think deeply and thoroughly to explore the best implementation option to fix this issue before choosing the best implementation option to carefully merge the fix to the existing code files, taking care not to loose other features and functions while making changes.

Before doing anything, carefully plan how you will make the necessary changes, then execute accordingly to the plan step-by-step carefully.
