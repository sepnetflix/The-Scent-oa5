You are a deep-thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution before answering. You will think deeply using the long chain of thoughts to carefully explore various options before choosing the best option to answer me. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

Now carefully reviewed the attached README.md and technical_design_specification.md and the .php files in the project sub-directories (includes, views, views/layout, views/layout, controllers and models) starting with .htaccess and index.php (root folder) so that you have thorough understanding of the current Apache + PHP + MySQL project for The Scent e-commerce platform. Then refer to the attached suggestions_for_improvement.md for suggestions to fix those issues found. Make sure you carefully review and validate the suggestions in suggestions_for_improvement.md before starting to plan and then execute.

based on your deep understanding of the current project state, please suggest how to fix the issue that the https://the-scent.com/index.php?page=product&id=1 output attached as "view_details_product_id-1.html" is showing the placeholder.jpg image instead of the actual product images? additional information is provided below. please also suggest how to improve the look and layout of the HTML page generated by "View Details" button on the main landing page  with above link, with a consistent UI design as the main landing page. the improved product details page should be informative and awesome looking, matching the best of a typical page would normally look like.

Think deeply and thoroughly to explore the best implementation option to fix this issue before choosing the best implementation option to carefully merge the fix to the existing code files, taking care not to loose other features and functions while making changes. You can use the suggestions from the attached suggestions_for_improvement_images.md file as your reference for validating your most optimal fixes for this issue. then document down your findings and suggestions in the markdown document with filename suggestions_for_improvement_images-v2.md

---
your next task is to carefully review the suggestions in the attached suggestions_for_improvement_images.md, then think deeply and systematically to carefully validate the suggested improvements against the current project code files and then explore thoroughly for the best implementation option to make the suggested improvements. then choose the best implementation option to carefully merge the validated changes to the existing code files, taking care not to loose other features and functions while making the changes.

Before doing anything, carefully plan how you will make the necessary changes, then execute accordingly to the plan step-by-step carefully.

---
You will carefully and systematically review the provided project documentation in the attached README.md, technical_design_specification.md files, the file structure listing (PHP_e-commerce_project_file_structure.md), and the code snippets from key files (content_of_code_files_1.md, content_of_code_files_2.md).

With the deep understanding of the current project state based on your careful review of the code files, think deeply and systematically to carefully and thoroughly explore the best implementation option to fix any logic and coding errors and to fix any functional issues and behavior inconsistencies, then choose the best implementation option to fix the issues. First validate your findings against the suggested improvements given below, 

---
below are the actual project files in the current project root folder (codebase), make sure you review them before assuming that some required .php code files are mssing. revise your previously derived execution plan if necessary, then continue with the revised plan to make careful edits (modifications) to the relevant files step by step according to the plan, taking care not to lose any existing application features and functionalities while enhancing it.

---
please continue to execute according to your plan.

make sure you edit the relevant files to fix the issues and not just tell me what you want to do or plan to do. I want you help me actually fix the issues identified and validated against the suggestions!
