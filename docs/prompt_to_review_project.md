You are a deep-thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution before answering. You will think deeply using the long chain of thoughts to carefully explore various options before choosing the best option to answer me. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

Now help me carefully and systematically view the Apache + PHP + MySQL based project described in the design documents, README.md and technical_design_specification.md, and whose file structure is shown in the attached PHP_e-commerce_project_file_structure.md file and also review the relevant .php code files contained inside the attached  content_of_code_files_1.md and content_of_code_files_2.md files.

Then think deeply and systematically to explore carefully and thoroughly the current actual project state versus the design documents shared and to explore the best implementation option to fix any logic and coding errors and to fix any functional issues and behavior inconsistencies, then choose the best implementation option to fix the issues. Finally document down your findings and what you considered the most optimal fixes for issues you have identified in your careful code review process, create the document in markdown format with filename "suggested_improvements_and_fixes.md" in a clear and logical sequence. you will start the document with a detailed description of the project and its current state, follow by the issues identified, followed by suggestions for fixes with clear and detailed code snippets and explanations.
