You are a deep-thinking and best AI coding assistant, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution before answering. You will think deeply using the long chain of thoughts to carefully explore various options before choosing the best option to answer me. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

Now help me carefully and systematically view the Apache + PHP + MySQL based project described in the design documents, README.md and technical_design_specification.md, and whose file structure is shown in the attached PHP_e-commerce_project_file_structure.md file and also review the relevant .php code files contained inside the attached  content_of_code_files_1.md, content_of_code_files_2.md and content_of_code_files_3.md files. The project database schema has been updated as shown in the attached the_scent_schema.sql.txt file.

Then think deeply and systematically to explore carefully and thoroughly the current actual project state versus the design documents shared and to explore the best implementation option to fix any logic and coding errors and to fix any functional issues and behavior inconsistencies, then choose the best implementation option to fix the issues. Finally document down your findings and what you considered the most optimal fixes for issues you have identified in your careful code review process, create the document in markdown format with filename "suggested_improvements_and_fixes.md" in a clear and logical sequence. you will start the document with a detailed description of the project and its current state, follow by the issues identified, followed by suggestions for fixes with clear and detailed code snippets and explanations.

Current Known Issues:

---
ou will thoroughly review the project description, design documents (`README.md`, `technical_design_specification.md v3`), the codebase file structure, database schema in `the_scent_schema.sql`), the provided PHP code files in includes, views, controllers and models sub-directories, starting with index.php and .htaccess files, and the current HTML outputs (`current_landing_page.html`, `view_details_product_id-1.html`, `shop_products.html`).

Use the following information as your guide to confirm your own independent careful code review and findings. After validating the issues and suggestions mentioned below, you can use the information below as your guide to think deeply and systematically to explore thoroughly the best implementation option before choosing the most optimal implementation option for making the necessary code changes. But before doing anything, first create a detailed step-by-step execution plan. Then proceed cautiously according to your well-thought-out execution plan to effect the code changes, taking care not to affect any of the existing features and functionalities of the application:

---
you have done an excellent job so far. now help me review of other controllers for similar AJAX/CSRF issues.

carefully review the relevant files, then think deeply and systematically to explore carefully and thoroughly for the best implementation option to implement any changes necessary, taking care not to loose other features and functions while making the changes.

Before doing anything, carefully plan how you will make the necessary changes, then execute accordingly to the plan step-by-step carefully.

---
Think deeply and systematically to explore carefully and thoroughly for the best implementation option to fix this issue before choosing the best implementation option to carefully merge the fix to the existing code files, taking care not to loose other features and functions while making changes.

Before doing anything, carefully plan how you will make the necessary changes, then execute accordingly to the plan step-by-step carefully.

I still get the following message for the SHOP link (https://the-scent.com/index.php?page=products):

Now carefully reviewed the attached README.md and technical_design_specification.md and the .php files in the project sub-directories (includes, views, views/layout, views/layout, controllers and models) starting with .htaccess and index.php (root folder) so that you have thorough understanding of the current Apache + PHP + MySQL project for The Scent e-commerce platform. Then refer to the attached suggestions_for_improvement.md for suggestions to fix those issues found. Make sure you carefully review and validate the suggestions in suggestions_for_improvement.md before starting to plan and then execute.
