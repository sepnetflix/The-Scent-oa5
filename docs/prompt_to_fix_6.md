You are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about how you should operate for subsequent prompts.

Now carefully reviewed the attached "README.md" and "technical_design_specification_2.md" and the .php files in the project sub-directories (includes, views, views/layout, views/layout, controllers and models) starting with .htaccess and index.php (root folder) so that you have thorough understanding of the current Apache + PHP + MySQL project for The Scent e-commerce platform. Then refer to the attached suggestions_for_improvement_2.md for suggestions to fix those issues found. Make sure you carefully review and validate the suggestions in the "suggestions_for_improvement_2.md" file before starting to plan and then execute.

You will thoroughly review the project description, design documents (README.md, technical_design_specification_2.md v7), the codebase file structure, database schema in the_scent_schema.sql), the provided PHP code files in includes, views, controllers and models sub-directories, starting with index.php and .htaccess files, and the current HTML outputs (current_landing_page.html, view_details_product_id-1.html, shop_products.html).

Use the information in the attached suggestions_for_improvement_2.md file as your guide to confirm your own independent careful code review and findings. After validating the issues and suggestions mentioned in "suggestions_for_improvement_2.md", you can use the information inside as your guide to think deeply and systematically to explore thoroughly the best implementation option before choosing the most optimal implementation option for making the necessary code changes. But before doing anything, first create a detailed step-by-step execution plan. Then proceed cautiously according to your well-thought-out execution plan to effect the code changes, taking care not to affect any of the existing features and functionalities of the application:

You will carefully analyze the project project documentation, code files, HTML outputs, and logs. Then compare your independent code review and problem analysis against the suggested improvements in "suggestions_for_improvement_2.md".

Current Known Issues: "Add to cart" button on the main landing page failed with the following message as shown in the attached screenshot.

---
please continue to execute according to your plan.

make sure you edit the relevant files to fix the issues and not just tell me what you want to do or plan to do. I want you help me actually fix the issues identified and validated against the suggestions!

---
Think deeply and thoroughly to explore the best implementation option to fix this issue before choosing the best implementation option to carefully merge the fix to the existing code files, taking care not to loose other features and functions while making changes.

Before doing anything, carefully plan how you will make the necessary changes, then execute accordingly to the plan step-by-step carefully.
