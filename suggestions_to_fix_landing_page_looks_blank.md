Carefully analyze the differences in landing page before and after the js/main/js refactor to pinpoint the likely cause of the blank page in `blank_landing_page.html`.

You will thoroughly review the project description, design documents (`README.md`, `technical_design_specification.md v3`), the codebase file structure, database schema in `the_scent_schema.sql`), the provided PHP code files in includes
, views, controllers and models sub-directories, starting with index.php and .htaccess files, and the current HTML outputs (`current_landing_page.html`, `view_details_product_id-1.html`, `shop_products.html`).

Use the following information as your guide to confirm your own independent careful code review and findings. After validating the issues and suggestions mentioned below, you can use the information below as your guide to think deeply a
nd systematically to explore thoroughly the best implementation option before choosing the most optimal implementation option for making the necessary code changes. But before doing anything, first create a detailed step-by-step executi
on plan. Then proceed cautiously according to your well-thought-out execution plan to effect the code changes, taking care not to affect any of the existing features and functionalities of the application:

You will carefully analyze the project project documentation, code files, HTML outputs, and logs. Then compare your independent code review and problem analysis against the suggested improvements below.

You will use the following thought process to analyze:

1.  **Analyze the Problem:** The user reports that `current_landing_page.html` renders as a blank white page, whereas a previous version worked. The key changes involved moving inline JavaScript to `main.js` and modifying `style.css`.

2.  **Examine `current_landing_page.html` Structure & Resources:**
    *   **CSS:**
        *   Google Fonts: OK.
        *   AOS CSS: OK.
        *   Font Awesome CSS: OK.
        *   Tailwind CDN: `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>` - This loads and processes Tailwind classes.
        *   Custom CSS: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css">` - Loads after Tailwind CDN. This order is generally fine, allowing custom CSS to override Tailwind if needed.
    *   **JavaScript:**
        *   `main.js`: `<script src="/js/main.js"></script>` - Loaded **BEFORE** Tailwind CDN.
        *   `main.js` (Duplicate): `<script src="/js/main.js"></script>` - Loaded again at the very end of the `<body>`.

3.  **Examine `previous_landing_page.html` Structure & Resources:**
    *   **CSS:** Same CSS resources loaded.
    *   **JavaScript:**
        *   Tailwind Config: Inline `<script>` containing `tailwind.config = {...}` placed **BEFORE** the Tailwind CDN script. This is the correct way to configure Tailwind when using the CDN.
        *   Mobile Menu JS: Inline `<script>` in the `<head>`.
        *   AOS Init & Particles JS Load: Inline `<script>` at the end of `<body>`.
        *   Newsletter/Add-to-Cart/Flash Message JS: Inline `<script>` blocks within the `<body>` or at the end.

4.  **Examine `main.js`:**
    *   **Line 2:** `window.tailwind = { ... };` - This defines the Tailwind configuration.
    *   **Line 18 onwards:** DOM manipulation, event listeners (`DOMContentLoaded`), AJAX calls, page-specific initializers (`initHomePage`, etc.).

5.  **Identify Key Differences and Potential Issues:**
    *   **Issue 1: Tailwind Configuration Loading Order (HIGHLY LIKELY THE CAUSE):**
        *   In `blank_landing_page.html`, `main.js` (which *contains* `window.tailwind = {...}`) is loaded *before* `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`.
        *   The Tailwind CDN script needs the `window.tailwind` configuration object to be defined *before* it runs, so it knows how to generate the necessary CSS classes based on your custom theme (colors like `primary`, `secondary`, fonts like `heading`, `body`).
        *   By loading `main.js` first, the configuration *is* defined, *but* then the Tailwind CDN script runs *after* it. This *should* theoretically work, *however*...
        *   Crucially, `main.js` *also* contains code that runs on `DOMContentLoaded` and potentially other immediate code. If any JS error occurs *within* `main.js` *before* the browser gets to process the rest of the page (including loading Tailwind), it could halt execution.
        *   **More importantly:** The original working version (`previous_landing_page.html`) explicitly put the Tailwind config *directly* before the CDN script. The new version loads the *entire* `main.js` file before the CDN script. This is a significant change in execution flow. The safest pattern for CDN usage is config -> CDN script. Loading a large JS file containing the config *before* the CDN is less conventional and potentially fragile.
        *   **Correction:** The Tailwind configuration *must* be defined globally *before* the `tailwindcss.com` script executes. Loading `main.js` *before* the CDN script achieves this, *assuming no errors in main.js halt execution early*. However, there's a second, more critical issue.

    *   **Issue 2: Duplicate Loading of `main.js` (DEFINITELY AN ERROR):**
        *   `blank_landing_page.html` includes `<script src="/js/main.js"></script>` *twice*. Once near the top (before Tailwind) and once at the bottom.
        *   This means the entire JavaScript file is executed twice.
        *   This will:
            *   Redefine `window.tailwind`.
            *   Re-register all `DOMContentLoaded` event listeners.
            *   Re-register global event listeners (like the delegated 'add-to-cart' click listener).
            *   Potentially cause unexpected behaviour due to functions being defined twice or listeners firing multiple times.
            *   Increase the chance of JavaScript errors.

    *   **Issue 3: Placement of the first `main.js` (POTENTIAL ISSUE):**
        *   Loading `main.js` in the `<head>` (or early `<body>`) means it executes before the full HTML DOM is parsed.
        *   While the core logic inside `main.js` is wrapped in `DOMContentLoaded`, simply loading and parsing the script itself *could* encounter an error that stops further page processing, leading to a blank screen. Errors *outside* the `DOMContentLoaded` wrapper would be particularly problematic.
        *   Standard practice is often to load non-critical JS like this at the *end* of the `<body>` (just before `</body>`) to ensure the HTML is parsed first, unless the script is needed earlier (like for critical rendering logic, which isn't the case here except for the Tailwind config part).

6.  **Synthesize the Diagnosis:**
    *   The most likely cause of the blank page is a fatal JavaScript error originating from the problematic loading sequence and duplication of `main.js`.
    *   Specifically, loading `main.js` before Tailwind CDN *and* loading it again at the end is incorrect. The duplicate loading is certainly wrong and could cause errors. Even without duplication, loading the *entire* `main.js` early might cause issues if there's an error during script parsing/initial execution before the DOM is ready or before other necessary resources are loaded.
    *   The critical Tailwind config needs to be available *before* the CDN script runs.

7.  **Formulate the Solution:**
    1.  **Fix Tailwind Config:** Separate the Tailwind configuration from the rest of `main.js`. Place the config in its own `<script>` tag immediately *before* the Tailwind CDN script, just like in the previous working version.
    2.  **Consolidate `main.js` Loading:** Remove the first `<script src="/js/main.js"></script>` tag (the one before Tailwind CDN). Keep only the *second* `<script src="/js/main.js"></script>` tag located just before the closing `</body>` tag. This ensures the rest of the JS runs after the DOM is parsed.
    3.  **Modify `main.js`:** Remove the `window.tailwind = {...};` block from `main.js` since it will now be inline in the HTML.
    4.  **Recommendation:** Advise checking the browser's developer console (F12 -> Console tab) for specific errors if the issue persists after these changes.

8.  **Refine the Plan (Self-Correction):** Is separating the config the *only* way? No. An alternative is to load `main.js` *once*, at the end of the body, but ensure the Tailwind CDN script comes *after* it. However, the standard, recommended pattern for the CDN is `config script -> CDN script`. Sticking to the pattern used in the *working* previous version is the safest and most direct fix. So, separating the config is the best approach here. The plan is solid.

Okay, let's break down the problem. The blank page is almost certainly caused by issues with how the JavaScript and CSS resources are being loaded, especially concerning the Tailwind CSS configuration and the duplicate loading of your `main.js` file.

Here's the diagnosis and how to fix it:

1.  **Critical Issue: Tailwind Configuration Loading Order:**
    *   **Problem:** Tailwind CSS (loaded via the CDN script `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`) needs its configuration (`window.tailwind = {...}`) to be defined *before* the CDN script runs. This tells Tailwind about your custom colours (`primary`, `secondary`, etc.) and fonts.
    *   **In `blank_landing_page.html`:** You've moved the `window.tailwind` configuration *inside* `main.js`. You load `main.js` *before* the Tailwind CDN script. While this technically defines the configuration before the CDN runs, loading the *entire* `main.js` file early is problematic (see next point) and deviates from the standard, safer pattern used in your previous working version.
    *   **In `previous_landing_page.html` (Working):** The configuration was correctly placed in an inline `<script>` tag *immediately before* the Tailwind CDN script.

2.  **Critical Issue: Duplicate Loading of `main.js`:**
    *   **Problem:** In `blank_landing_page.html`, you have `<script src="/js/main.js"></script>` listed *twice*: once before the Tailwind CDN script, and again at the very end of the `<body>`.
    *   **Effect:** This causes your entire JavaScript file to be parsed and executed twice. This is incorrect and can lead to:
        *   JavaScript errors halting page rendering.
        *   Event listeners being attached multiple times, causing unexpected behaviour.
        *   Functions and variables being redefined.

3.  **Potential Issue: Early Loading of `main.js`:**
    *   **Problem:** Loading the first instance of `main.js` before the main page content and other resources might cause errors if the script tries to interact with DOM elements that don't exist yet (even though much logic is deferred with `DOMContentLoaded`, parsing errors can still occur) or if other dependencies aren't met.

**Solution:**

To fix `blank_landing_page.html`, you need to replicate the *correct loading order* from the previous version regarding the Tailwind configuration and load `main.js` only *once* in the appropriate place.

1.  **Modify `blank_landing_page.html`:**
    *   **Remove** the first `<script src="/js/main.js"></script>` line (the one before the Tailwind CDN script).
    *   **Add** the Tailwind configuration back as an inline script immediately *before* the Tailwind CDN script.
    *   Ensure the *second* (and now only) `<script src="/js/main.js"></script>` remains at the end of the `<body>`, just before the closing `</body>` tag.

    Your `<head>` section (and relevant script tags) should look like this:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>The Scent - Premium Aromatherapy Products</title>

        <!-- !!! STEP 1: Add Tailwind Config HERE !!! -->
        <script>
            window.tailwind = {
                theme: {
                    extend: {
                        colors: {
                            primary: '#1A4D5A',
                            'primary-dark': '#164249', // Match your main.js if different
                            secondary: '#A0C1B1',
                            accent: '#D4A76A',
                            // Add any other customizations you had
                        },
                        fontFamily: {
                            heading: ['Cormorant Garamond', 'serif'],
                            body: ['Montserrat', 'sans-serif'],
                            accent: ['Raleway', 'sans-serif'],
                        },
                    },
                },
            };
        </script>

        <!-- !!! STEP 2: Load Tailwind CDN AFTER config !!! -->
        <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>

        <!-- Custom CSS -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css">

        <!-- !!! STEP 3: REMOVE main.js from here !!! -->
        <!-- <script src="/js/main.js"></script> --> /* DELETE THIS LINE */

    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- ... your header, main, footer content ... -->

        <!-- Scripts -->
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/aos@next/dist/aos.js"></script>

        <!-- !!! STEP 4: Keep ONLY ONE main.js load here at the end !!! -->
        <script src="/js/main.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

2.  **Modify `main.js`:**
    *   **Remove** the `window.tailwind = { ... };` block from the beginning of `main.js`, as it's now handled inline in the HTML. Your `main.js` should start directly with the mobile menu logic or other functions.

    ```javascript
    // REMOVE THIS BLOCK FROM main.js:
    /*
    window.tailwind = {
        theme: {
            extend: {
                colors: {
                    primary: '#1A4D5A',
                    secondary: '#A0C1B1',
                    accent: '#D4A76A',
                },
                fontFamily: {
                    heading: ['Cormorant Garamond', 'serif'],
                    body: ['Montserrat', 'sans-serif'],
                    accent: ['Raleway', 'sans-serif'],
                },
            },
        },
    };
    */

    // Mobile menu toggle
    window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
        // ... rest of your main.js code
    });

    // ... rest of your main.js code
    ```

**After making these changes:**

1.  Clear your browser cache.
2.  Reload `blank_landing_page.html`.
3.  **Crucially:** Open your browser's Developer Tools (usually F12) and check the **Console** tab. Look for any red error messages. These will give you specific clues if any other JavaScript issues remain. Also check the **Network** tab to ensure `main.js` and `style.css` are loading successfully (Status 200 OK).

These steps address the incorrect script loading order and the duplicate script execution, which are the most probable reasons for the blank page.
