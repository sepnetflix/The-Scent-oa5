Here's a breakdown of the thinking process to review and update `main.js`:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The request is to review the provided `main.js` and update it, specifically to handle the AJAX form submissions for authentication (login, register, password reset) required by the refactored `AccountController`, which now returns JSON.

2.  **Initial Scan and Structure:**
    *   The file uses `DOMContentLoaded` correctly to wrap most initializers.
    *   It uses a body class (`page-*`) pattern to call page-specific initialization functions (`initHomePage`, `initLoginPage`, etc.). This is a good practice.
    *   It has a global `showFlashMessage` utility.
    *   It uses event delegation for `.add-to-cart` buttons.
    *   It handles newsletter submissions via AJAX.
    *   AOS animation library is initialized globally.
    *   Mini-cart update function `fetchMiniCart` is defined.
    *   The structure seems reasonable.

3.  **Identify Key Areas for Change (based on previous PHP changes):**
    *   `initLoginPage()`: Needs AJAX submission for `#loginForm`.
    *   `initRegisterPage()`: Needs AJAX submission for `#registerForm`.
    *   `initForgotPasswordPage()`: Needs AJAX submission for `#forgotPasswordForm`.
    *   `initResetPasswordPage()`: Needs AJAX submission for `#resetPasswordForm`.
    *   These AJAX handlers need to:
        *   Prevent default form submission.
        *   Gather form data (including CSRF token).
        *   Use `fetch` to POST to the correct endpoint (`index.php?page=...`).
        *   Handle JSON response (`success`, `message`, `redirect`).
        *   Show loading state on the submit button.
        *   Display success/error messages using `showFlashMessage`.
        *   Redirect on success using `window.location.href`.
        *   Reset loading state on completion (success or error).

4.  **Review Existing Code for Potential Issues:**
    *   **CSRF Tokens:** The add-to-cart and newsletter handlers correctly grab the CSRF token from a hidden input (`#csrf-token-value`). This needs to be consistent for the new AJAX forms. Ensure the corresponding PHP views (`login.php`, `register.php`, etc.) include `<input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="...">`.
    *   **Loading States:** The existing AJAX handlers (add-to-cart, newsletter) implement button loading states. This pattern should be replicated for the new auth forms.
    *   **Error Handling:** The existing handlers use `try...catch` and check `response.ok`. They also attempt to handle non-JSON responses. This robustness should be maintained. `showFlashMessage` is used correctly.
    *   **Mini Cart:** The `fetchMiniCart` function seems well-structured for updating the mini cart display after actions like add-to-cart.
    *   **Password Visibility:** The toggles in `initLoginPage`, `initRegisterPage`, and `initResetPasswordPage` look correct.
    *   **Password Validation (Register/Reset):** The live validation logic using requirement elements (`#req-length`, etc.) seems functional. It correctly enables/disables the submit button.
    *   **Cart Page Logic:** The cart page initialization (`initCartPage`) handles quantity updates and removals using event delegation and local UI updates followed by backend calls. This looks generally good. It includes optimistic UI updates for removal. The total calculation relies on local DOM parsing, which is okay but could be slightly less robust than getting totals from the server response if AJAX updates were implemented.
    *   **AOS Initialization:** Moving `AOS.init()` to the main `DOMContentLoaded` handler is correct to ensure it applies globally.

5.  **Plan the Implementation (AJAX Auth Forms):**
    *   For each relevant `init*` function (`initLoginPage`, `initRegisterPage`, etc.):
        *   Get the form element by ID.
        *   Get the submit button.
        *   Add an event listener for the `submit` event on the form.
        *   Inside the listener:
            *   Call `e.preventDefault()`.
            *   Perform basic client-side validation if needed (though backend validation is primary).
            *   Get the CSRF token from the hidden input within *that specific form*.
            *   Show the loading state on the submit button.
            *   Create `FormData` from the form.
            *   Use `fetch` to POST the `FormData` to the correct URL (`form.action`).
            *   Include necessary headers (`Accept: application/json`). *Note: `FormData` usually sets `Content-Type` automatically to `multipart/form-data`, but PHP might handle `$_POST` correctly anyway. Alternatively, manually build URL-encoded data if needed, but `FormData` is often easier.* Let's stick with `FormData` for now.
            *   Handle the JSON response: check `response.ok`, parse JSON, check `data.success`.
            *   If success: `showFlashMessage(data.message)`, `window.location.href = data.redirect`.
            *   If error: `showFlashMessage(data.error)`.
            *   Use a `.finally()` block to hide the loading state and re-enable the button.
            *   Include `.catch()` for network errors.

6.  **Refine and Write Code:** Implement the plan from step 5 within the respective `init*` functions.

7.  **Review and Verify:**
    *   Check that CSRF tokens are correctly included in `FormData` or the request body.
    *   Ensure loading states are handled correctly (shown on start, hidden on completion/error).
    *   Verify that redirection happens only on `data.success === true` and `data.redirect` exists.
    *   Confirm error messages are displayed appropriately.
    *   Double-check form IDs and action URLs.
    *   Ensure no console errors remain.

8.  **Self-Correction Example during review:** Initially, you might forget to add the CSRF token to the `FormData`. During review (step 7), I'd realize the backend expects it (based on `AccountController`'s `validateCSRFToken`) and add `formData.append('csrf_token', csrfToken)` or ensure the hidden input is part of the form being serialized. Another correction: Ensure the target URL for fetch matches the form's action attribute or is constructed correctly. Also, confirm that using `FormData` with fetch is compatible with how the PHP backend expects to receive POST data (it generally is, accessing via `$_POST`).

This systematic process helps ensure all requirements are met, existing functionality is reviewed, and the new AJAX logic is implemented correctly and consistently.
